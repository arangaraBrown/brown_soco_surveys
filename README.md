Welcome to the Brown | Social Compact Surveys!

Authors: Sneha and Ari!

The purpose of these surveys are to understand the information, incentives, and social psychology that affect how site managers and labor contractors treat their workers. 
Each of the questions has a landing point attached to it (e.g. dehumanization, stress, promotion_incentive, etc.). Many of these were taken from work by Laura Babbit and Drusilla Brown of
Tufts University.
